# Horoscope Insights — Cyber Scam Awareness Project

## 🎯 Objective

This project was developed as a creative and educational tool to simulate how online scams can be disguised behind seemingly innocent platforms — such as daily horoscope sites.

Using an engaging and familiar user experience, the platform demonstrates how cyber threats often begin: with trust, distraction, and a simple click. The site mimics real-world scam patterns by guiding users through fake flows (e.g., repeated "Get Horoscope" interactions leading to a "pricing" page), and eventually reveals the deceptive nature of the experience — raising awareness about phishing, scam tactics, and social engineering.

The core purpose is to educate everyday users, especially non-technical audiences, about how easily scams can manipulate human behavior online.


## 🧠 Skills and Concepts Covered

- Understanding of social engineering techniques and behavioral triggers  
- Creation of engaging yet deceptive UX flows to simulate phishing  
- Hands-on use of Flask, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite for rapid prototyping  
- Building responsive and accessible user interfaces  
- Raising cybersecurity awareness through creative design and education  
- Demonstrating common scam entry points: fake pricing, urgent messages, redirect buttons  


## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)** – lightweight Python framework for serving pages and routing logic  
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** + **[Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/)** – utility-first design system with clean, modern components  
- **[Horoscope API](https://horoscope-app-api.vercel.app/)** – used to serve real astrological data and maintain user engagement  
- **[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)** – templating for clean HTML generation
